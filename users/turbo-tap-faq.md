# Turbo Tap FAQ

[Turbo Tap](https://tap.eclipse.xyz/) is a clicker game where the more you click, the more grass Turbo gets!

<details>

<summary>How do I get an invite code?</summary>

The first batch of invite codes is reserved exclusively for Eclipse Guardians and OGs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why is AllDomains asking to connect my X account and my Discord account?</summary>

Your X account, Discord account, and wallet address are tied to your .turbo domain, which is powered by AllDomains. This not only allows you to create a Turbo Tap account, but also enables you to port your information across the ecosystem!

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why can't I connect my X account?</summary>

Check if you've already linked your X to another wallet address. If you're still having trouble, look for the "pubkey" in the URL for the correct wallet address you should connect.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why can't I join the Eclipse Discord?</summary>

Make sure the Discord account you're using is not a new account and satisfies the minimum account age requirement. This ensures that you're a verified and active member of the community.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why is the "Mint" button disabled when I try to mint my domain?</summary>

You need a small amount of ETH for gas to complete the transaction. Don't worry, the domain itself is free for 6 months, and you can choose to whether or not to renew it later.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why do I have to purchase clicks?</summary>

To prevent bots and autoclickers and to ensure a fair and enjoyable experience for all players, we've implemented a system that requires each click to be an onchain transaction. This means that each click requires a small amount of gas. The good news is that gas fees on Eclipse are extremely low (0.00000005 ETH per click).&#x20;

This not only helps to prevent abuse but also showcases the throughput capabilities of Eclipse mainnet.

<summary>What happens if I clear my cache?</summary>

Unfortunately, you'll lose your previously purchased clicks.

</details>

<summary>Why doesn't my number of clicks match the number of grass on the top left? </summary>

There might be a slight delay in updating the UI, but don't worry, it'll catch up soon!
